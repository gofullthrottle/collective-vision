### Need it for my own projects atm, but Intention is for it to be an Agentic AI-Powered SaaS Product later

Clone UserVoice.com Features and Competitors' Features While Keeping Things Relatively Simple & Straightforward & Beautifully Design
- A simple user feedback system where users can submit ideas, vote on them, and comment.
- Build the system so that it can be easily integrated into any website, similar to Disqus, but for user feedback.
- Build the system so I can very cheaply host it via CloudFlare
- Present a list of UserVoice.com features and competitors' features in order to identify any additional features to implement.
- If the Product being reviewed is an MCP Server, then the MCP Server itself should have a tool for providing feedback on the MCP Server, and so our system should be able to integrate with that tool and receive the feedback (even if it means that the feedback is hidden until a moderator can approve it)

# Future feature enhancements:
- Monitor Reddit and other social media for mentions of the product and automatically create feedback entries.
- If a piece of feedback is created on Reddit, automagically sync any comments on Reddit to the feedback entry in our system.
- Implement AI-powered sentiment analysis on user feedback to prioritize features.
- Create a mobile app version of the feedback system for easier access.
- Build in an MCP Server so that developers can use the MCP Server to query the feedback system for feedback items which have been tagged with specific tags (e.g., "bug", "feature request", etc.) and whether or not the team Administrator has marked the feedback item as being "Accepted" for implementation.
- AI will deeply analyze feedback, user sentiment, emerging market trends, and perform a competitive analysis to recommend the most impactful features to implement next, and will perform sequential thinking in order to put together a proposed solution for the feedback.
- AI Agents constantly monitoring social media, git repositories, blogosphere, documentation searches and questions, Google Analytics data, Google Web Console Data, Microsoft Clarity Data, E-mails, Sentry Errors, RUM APM Data, Tracked User Sessions, and other sources to identify potential areas of improvement and automatically generate feedback entries for review by the product team.
- Integrate with project management tools like Jira, Trello, or Asana to automatically create tasks based on user feedback.
- AI Agents Active on Company Managed Discord Servers, Slack Workspaces, and other Communication Platforms to gather, engage with, and POST new feedback items based on MULTI-CHANNEL-WIDE user interactions and sentiments, and the responses to those.  Upon decisions made regarding Feedback Items, AI Agents will go out in force to communicate those decisions to the users so that users feel heard, valued, and appreciated!
