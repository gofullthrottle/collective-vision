## PHASE 5: MONETIZATION & GTM STRATEGY

### Pricing Innovation
- **Anti-UserVoice pricing:** Transparent, affordable, scales gracefully
- **Usage-based options:** Pay for value (feedback processed, insights generated, time saved)
- **Hybrid models:** Base platform + AI credits for advanced features
- **Free tier that actually works:** Generous limits to attract small teams
- **Enterprise without sticker shock:** Enterprise features without enterprise prices

### Target Segments
1. **Underserved SaaS startups:** Priced out of UserVoice, outgrowing Canny
2. **Product-led growth companies:** Need feedback at scale, can't afford per-seat pricing
3. **AI-forward teams:** Want cutting-edge AI, not retrofitted features
4. **Cost-conscious enterprises:** Want enterprise features at reasonable cost
5. **Solo founders & indie hackers:** Need professional feedback tools on a budget

### Differentiation Strategy
- **"The AI-first feedback platform"**
- **"Built for the Claude Code era"**
- **"Feedback management that manages itself"**
- **"From feedback chaos to product clarity in minutes, not weeks"**
- **"What UserVoice should have become"**

### Go-to-Market Angles
1. **Content-led:** "I built feedback management for the AI age" (John's story)
2. **Comparison-led:** "UserVoice vs. [Your Product]" content
3. **Cost-savings angle:** "Save $18k/year vs. UserVoice"
4. **AI-native positioning:** "First feedback tool with native agent support"
5. **Developer-first:** "API-first, MCP-native, built for automation"
6. **Transparent pricing:** Public pricing calculator, no sales calls

## PHASE 6: RESEARCH EXECUTION PLAN

### Step 1: Deep Dive on Each Competitor
For each of the 8 main competitors:
1. Sign up for free trials where available
2. Break down core workflows (submit feedback, vote, comment, admin)
4. Document all features observed
5. Note performance (page load times, responsiveness)
6. Extract pricing from pages and calculators
7. Collect user reviews from G2, Capterra, ProductHunt
8. Analyze marketing positioning and messaging

### Step 2: Feature Matrix Construction
Build comprehensive spreadsheet:
- Rows: All features identified (100+ rows)
- Columns: Each competitor + "AI-First Platform" (your vision)
- Cells: ✅ (has feature), ⚠️ (partial), ❌ (missing), 🤖 (AI-enhanced in your product)
- Color-code opportunities (features you could do better)

### Step 3: Market Sizing
Calculate TAM/SAM/SOM:
- **TAM:** All SaaS companies globally (need feedback management)
- **SAM:** SaaS companies with $1M+ ARR (can afford tools)
- **SOM:** Early adopters interested in AI-first tools (reachable in Year 1)
